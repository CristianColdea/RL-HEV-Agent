## General info
* The objective of this project is to have a Reinforcement Learning Agent able to manage the complex HEV Powertrain.
* The agent will work based on a number of reward shaping systems, i.e., a system of systems in a cybernetic way.
* Precisely this is going to be a Deep Q-Network agent.
* The reward shaping systems are as following:
    * charge-discharge;
    * fuel consumption map;
    * electric motor (EM) efficiency map;
    * gear shift.
