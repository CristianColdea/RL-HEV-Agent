## Power flows at HEV Powertrain level
* Elementary flows
1. ICE -> main transmission -> wheels
2. Battery -> EM -> EM transmission -> wheels
3. ICE -> EG transmission -> EG


### Short abbreviations list and some clarifications
* Internal Combustion Engine = ICE
* Electric Motor = EM
* Electric Generator = EG
* Main transmission = involves gearbox, main gear ratio and differential
* EM transmission = involves EM reduction gear
* EG transmission = involves EG increasing gear
