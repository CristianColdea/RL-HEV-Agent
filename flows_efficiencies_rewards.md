## Power flows at HEV Powertrain level
* Elementary flows
    * ICE -> main transmission -> wheels
    * Battery -> EM -> EM transmission -> wheels
    * ICE -> EG transmission -> EG -> battery

* Combined flows
    * (ICE -> main transmission -> wheels &&
          battery -> EM -> EM transmission -> wheels)
    * (ICE -> main transmission -> wheels &&
          ICE -> EG transmission -> EG -> battery)
    * (ICE -> main transmission -> wheels &&
          battery -> EM -> EM transmission -> wheels &&
          ICE -> EG transmission -> EG -> battery)

### Short abbreviations list and some clarifications
* Internal Combustion Engine = ICE
* Electric Motor = EM
* Electric Generator = EG
* Main transmission = involves gearbox, main gear ratio and differential
* EM transmission = involves EM reduction gear
* EG transmission = involves EG increasing gear
