## Power flows at HEV Powertrain level
* Elementary flows
    * ICE -> main transmission -> wheels
    * battery -> EM -> EM transmission -> wheels
    * ICE -> EG transmission -> EG -> battery

* Combined flows
    * (ICE -> main transmission -> wheels &&
          battery -> EM -> EM transmission -> wheels)
    * (ICE -> main transmission -> wheels &&
          ICE -> EG transmission -> EG -> battery)
    * (ICE -> main transmission -> wheels &&
          battery -> EM -> EM transmission -> wheels &&
          ICE -> EG transmission -> EG -> battery)

## Subsystem chains
* ICE -> main transmission -> wheels
* battery -> inverter -> EM -> EM transmission -> wheels
* ICE -> EG transmission -> EG -> rectifier-transformer -> battery
