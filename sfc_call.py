"""
Within this script the SFC script call is going to take place.
A total number of 19 variables are needed to be passed as
arguments to the classes and functions within SFC simulator.
Out of this total number of variables 15 are 'fixed', i.e., are
not changing with the conditions at agent/drive train level.
In order to simplify the SFC script invocation the 'fixed'
variables are to be passed as a list build only once.
As for the other mutable variables these must be passed
individually. Please read the explanatory document carefully to
understand which script are belonging to either category and the
order of arguments.
